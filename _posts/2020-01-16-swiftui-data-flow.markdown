What makes SwiftUI different from UIKit? For one, it's the *layout system*, I covered it in one of my [previous articles]({{ site.url }}/post/swiftui-layout-system). Another, probably an even more dramatic difference, is the *data flow*. 

In UIKit, you have a lot of decisions to make. Are you going to observe changes to data to refresh the UI (aka *views as a function of state*) or update the UI after performing every update (aka *views as a sequence of events*)? Are you going to set-up bindings using your favorite reactive programming framework or use a target-action mechanism? SwiftUI is an opinionated framework, it has answers to all of these questions.

SwiftUI provides a rich set of tools for propagating data changes across the app. This article will get you from zero to fully understanding how data flow works in SwiftUI, and to writing *gorgeous* SwiftUI code like [this](#full-listing-search).

{% include ad-hor.html %}

## @Published

Let's go over all of the new tools. The first and most basic one is [`@Published`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/published). `@Published` is technically a part of the [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) framework but you don't have to import it because SwiftUI has its `typealias`.

Let's say you are implementing a search functionality in a music player. You defined a view model which you are planning to populate with the search results[^1] and get the UI to update when the results do.

```swift
final class SearchViewModel {
    private(set) var songs: [Song] = []
}
```

Now, how do you propagate the changes to the `songs` array to the view? If you were using [`ReactiveSwift`](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift), you would typically use [`Property`](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift/blob/master/Documentation/ReactivePrimitives.md#property-an-observable-box-that-always-holds-a-value) type to make `songs` property *observable*.

```swift
// ReactiveSwift

final class SearchViewModel {
    private(set) lazy var songs = Property<[Song]>(_songs)
    private let _songs = MutableProperty<[Song]>([])
}
```

This works, but it's not very nice. You have to create[^2] a `MutableProperty` to back a user-facing `Property` to prevent users from modifying it. Fortunately, SwiftUI provides a more elegant solution:

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">SearchViewModel</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="SwiftUIPostHighlightedCode kd">@Published</span> <span class="kd">private(set)</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">songs</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">Song</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

`@Published` is a [Property Wrapper](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html#ID617) which exposes a Combine `Publisher` making a property observable.

> [**Property Wrappers**](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html#ID617)
>
> Property wrappers were introduced in Swift 5.1 to allow users to add additional behavior to properties, similar to what `lazy` modifier does. You can read more about property wrappers in the [documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html#ID617), and the Swift Evolution [proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0258-property-wrappers.md).

The beauty of `@Published` as a property wrapper is that it composes well with the existing Swift access control modifiers. By marking `songs` with `private(set)` we are able to restrict write access to the property.

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">SearchViewModel</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">@Published</span> <span class="SwiftUIPostHighlightedCode kd">private(set)</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">songs</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">Song</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

Another advantage of property wrappers is that to access the current value you can simply write `viewModel.songs` using the basic property syntax. Compare it to `viewModel.songs.value` in ReactiveSwift.

Here is what Apple documentation says about `@Published`:

> Properties annotated with `@Published` contain both the stored value and a publisher which sends any new values after the property value has been sent. New subscribers will receive the current value of the property first. Note that the `@Published` property is class-constrained. Use it with properties of classes, not with non-class types like structures.

Now, what this all means is that by making property `@Published`, you are able to observe the changes made to it.

<div class="SwiftUIExampleWithScreenshot Any-responsiveCard">
    <div class="SwiftUIExampleWithScreenshot_Flex">
        <!-- To the left: title, subtitle, etc -->
        <div class="SwiftUIExampleWithScreenshot_FlexItem SwiftUIExampleWithScreenshot_Left3">
        	There are two ways to access property wrappers: as a regular property and as a "projection".
        </div>
        <!-- To the right: image -->
        <div class="SwiftUIExampleWithScreenshot_FlexItem SwiftUIExampleWithScreenshot_Right3">
			<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/posts/swiftui-data-flow/published.png">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

By using `$` you access a *projection* of the property which in case of `@Published` returns a Combine `Publisher`. This is just a regular `Publisher`, no compiler magic in sight.

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

Because the `projectedValue` conforms to `Combine.Publisher` protocol, you can use `map`, `sink`, `filter` and other Combine facilities to manipulate it.


<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">Player</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

Let's see how it works in action.

```swift
let player = Player()

print("Will subscribe")

player.$currentSong.sink {
    print("Received value: \($0?.name ?? "not playing")")
}

print("Did subscribe")

player.currentSong = Song(name: "Civilization Collapse", style: .metal)
```

```
Will subscribe
Received value: not playing
Did subscribe
Received value: Civilization Collapse
```

The `currentSong` publisher delivers the current value of the property synchronously the moment you subscribe to it.

## @ObservedObject

We learned about `@Published` and Property Wrappers in general, but it's not enough to know how to update views in SwiftUI.

Let's start with how you would typically *bind* the state to the views using a reactive programming framework, like ReactiveSwift. In ReactiveSwift, you either observe the changes and reload the UI, or, in case of simple properties, bind them directly to the UI elements.

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// ReactiveSwift</span><br/><br/><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">SearchView</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nf">UIView</span> <span class="p">{</span>

        <span class="c1">// Unlike RxSwift, there is no `UITableView` binding provided by ReactiveSwift,</span>

                <span class="k">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tableView</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">reloadData</span><span class="p">()</span>
            <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

This gets the job done, and in case of `<~` binding in an elegant way – the syntax is minimal and the observation lifetime is automatically taken care of for you. As a result, the views always reflect the latest state of the model – something that SwiftUI also aims to do. How do you do the same thing in SwiftUI?

To start observing the changes to the model, you use [`@ObservedObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/observedobject) property wrapper. An `@ObservedObject` must be initialized with a value confirming to [`ObservableObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject) protocol.

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="kt">SearchView</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nf">View</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="SwiftUIPostHighlightedCode kd">@ObservedObject</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">viewModel</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">SearchViewModel</span>

    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nf">body</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kd">some</span> <span class="nf">View</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nf">List</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">viewModel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="kt">songs</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nf">Text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="kt">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">SearchViewModel</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="SwiftUIPostHighlightedCode nf">ObservableObject</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">@Published</span> <span class="kd">private(set)</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">songs</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">Song</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

Now every time the `songs` property changes, the `SearchView` is updated. Now, how does any of this actually work?

`ObservableObject` is a simple protocol with a single requirement:

```swift
public protocol ObservableObject: AnyObject {

    /// The type of publisher that emits before the object has changed.
    associatedtype ObjectWillChangePublisher: Publisher = ObservableObjectPublisher
    	where Self.ObjectWillChangePublisher.Failure == Never

    /// A publisher that emits before the object has changed.
    var objectWillChange: Self.ObjectWillChangePublisher { get }
}
```

And now this is where a bit of compiler magic begins 🎩✨. By default, Swift compiler synthesizes an `objectWillChange` publisher that emits the value before any of its `@Published` properties changes 🤯.

If you didn't want to rely on the compiler magic, all you had to do was implement `objectWillChange` manually.

```swift
final class SearchViewModel: ObservableObject {
    let objectWillChange = PassthroughSubject<Void, Never>()

    private(set) var songs: [Song] = [] {
        willSet { objectWillChange.send() }
    }
}
```

Where did `@Published` go? Turns out, the views in SwiftUI don't subscribe to the publishers projected by `@Published`. All they need is `objectWillChange` publisher from `ObservableObject`.

The final piece of the puzzle is `@ObservedObject` property wrapper. All it does is subscribe to an `ObservableObject` automatically invalidating the view when it changes. That's it! No magic involved. Except for one small thing... How does SwiftUI know when to update the view?

Unfortunately, we don't know for sure, these are SwiftUI internal implementation details. However, we can speculate. If you look into `@ObservedObject` declaration, you can find out that is conforms to [`DynamicProperty`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/dynamicproperty) protocol. Turns out, all other SwiftUI property wrappers related to data flow do.

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">@propertyWrapper</span> <span class="kd">@frozen</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

As a thought experiment, I implemented a `_ViewRendererHost` class which uses Swift reflection ([`Mirror`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mirror)) to find all of the dynamic properties at runtime, including observed objects, subscribe to changes to these properties and automatically refresh the view.

## @Binding

Let's finish our search example. We need a search field. Unfortunately, at the moment of writing this, SwiftUI didn't provide one, but we can use an existing `TextField` for now. To instantiate it, you need to pass a binding.

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="kt">SearchView</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">View</span> <span class="p">{</span>

Binding creates a two-way connection between a view and its underlying model. This is something that you won't find in ReactiveSwift or RxSwift. It is also relatively complicated compared to other SwiftUI property wrappers.

How do you create a binding? One way to do it is by using the *projected value* of the `@ObservedObject`.

This feature takes advantage of multiple new Swift language features including [`@dynamicMemberLookup`](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0252-keypath-dynamic-member-lookup.md). If you look at the `@ObserverObject` declaration, its projected value has a special `Wrapper` type.

```swift
@propertyWrapper @frozen
public struct ObservedObject<ObjectType>: DynamicProperty where ObjectType: ObservableObject {
    /// A wrapper of the underlying `ObservableObject` that can create
    /// `Binding`s to its properties using dynamic member lookup.
    @dynamicMemberLookup @frozen public struct Wrapper {

        /// Creates a `Binding` to a value semantic property of a
        /// reference type.
        public subscript<Subject>(
            dynamicMember keyPath: ReferenceWritableKeyPath<ObjectType, Subject>
        ) -> Binding<Subject> { get }
    }

    public var projectedValue: ObservedObject<ObjectType>.Wrapper { get }
}
```

Interestingly, `@Binding` itself also supports `@dynamicMemberLookup`. It allows you to reach properties nested in other types. For example, if you had more complicated search criteria, you could do the following:

```swift
struct SearchCriteria {
    var query: String = ""
    var filters: [SearchFilter] = []
}

final class SearchViewModel: ObservableObject {
    var searchCriteria = SearchCriteria()
    @Published private(set) var songs: [Song] = []
}

struct SearchView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: SearchViewModel

    var body: some View {
        ...
        TextField("Search", text: $viewModel.searchCriteria.query)
        ...
    }
}
```

Nice. And there is more. You can create bindings with a constant value like this `.constant("term")` which is useful for testing. Or you could create a completely custom binding using a special initializer which takes `getter` and `setter` as input. I couldn't come up with any use cases for it yet, but it's nice to know this option exists.

And now, to complete our classic search example, let's make `query` observable and sprinkle a bit more Combine[^3] on top of what we already have:

## @State

> SwiftUI automatically manages the storage for your state properties. When the state value changes, the view invalidates its appearance and recomputes the body.
>
>You must only access a state property from inside the view’s body (or from functions called by it). For this reason, you should declare your state properties as private, to prevent clients of your view from accessing it.
>
>You can get a binding from a state with the `binding` property, or by using the `$` prefix operator.

[`@State`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state) is probably the most situational property wrapper of the bunch. You will only use for some transient state local to a particular view. You might use it more often if your views talk directly to the model, but as long as you are using MVVM (and I think you should), you won't find a lot of use cases for `@State`.

One of the common scenarios for using `@State` is presenting some temporary screens like alerts. SwiftUI insists that you do it declaratively.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isAlertShown = false

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: { self.isAlertShown = true }) {
            Text("Show alert")
        }.alert(isPresented: $isAlertShown) {
            Alert(title: Text("Hello"))
        }
    }
}
```

If you think about how `@State` might be implemented, you will notice that the way it works is almost identical to `@ObservedObject`. The only major difference is that *you* provide the storage for `@ObservedObject`, and in the case of `@State` SwiftUI automatically creates storage for you.

Again, we don't know how it is actually implemented, but we can easily extend the [`_ViewRendererHost`](#_ViewRendererHost) prototype to support `@State`. The moment SwiftUI creates an instance of `_ViewRendererHost` to represent a view in a view graph, it scans through the view's properties using reflection to find the ones which are `@State`. For each of the properties, it creates a storage that probably also implements `ObservableObject` protocol. It then subscribes to the changes to the newly created observable objects.

In fact, if you use reflection to inspect what stored properties `@State` has, you can see it does have some reference-type `StoredLocation` type:

```
(lldb) po Mirror(reflecting: $isShown).children.map { $0 }
▿ 3 elements
  ▿ 0 : 2 elements
    ▿ label : Optional<String>
      - some : "transaction"
    ▿ value : Transaction
      ▿ plist : []
        - elements : nil
  ▿ 1 : 2 elements
    ▿ label : Optional<String>
      - some : "location"
    ▿ value : <StoredLocation<Bool>: 0x600001d299f0>
  ▿ 2 : 2 elements
    ▿ label : Optional<String>
      - some : "_value"
    - value : false
```

This implementation (WARNING: this is just speculation) also explains the rules behind how long SwiftUI persists the `@State`. The `@State` is held in memory until you remove the view from the view hierarchy. At this point, SwiftUI most likely destroys the respective `_ViewRendererHost` along with all of its subscriptions and storages for `@State`. But if you simply hide the view using [`hidden()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/3278576-hidden), the state persists.

## @Environment

[`@Environment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environment) provides access to the environment of the view. SwiftUI provides a variety of [environment values](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentvalues) that you can observe. Here are just some of them:

```swift
@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) var horizontalSizeClass
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceTransparency) var reduceTransparency
@Environment(\.accessibilityEnabled) var accessibilityEnabled
```

The view is automatically invalidated when one of the observed environment values changes.

You can also manually modify the environment which comes in handy in previews:

```swift
struct SearchView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        Group {
            SearchView()
            SearchView()
                .environment(\.colorScheme, .dark)
        }
    }
}
```

<b>@EnvironmentObject</b>

In addition to `@Environment` there is an [`@EnvironmentObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentobject) property wrapper which has little to do with the `@Environment`. The `@EnvironmentObject` is a way to pass all sorts of custom data indirectly down through your view hierarchy.

This is probably the only part of SwiftUI which I strongly disagree with. Introducing implicit dependencies to my views, which will crash if the value is not provided, just doesn't sound like a great idea to me. And the value that `@EnvironmentObject` brings is questionable.

This is where Apple probably went a little bit too far with their idea of "the shortest path to a great app". It is worth using `@EnvironmentObject` to save a couple of lines of code? I don't think so.

## Final Thoughts

I've missed you, `@`. I'm glad SwiftUI finally brings you back, and in a big way. On a more serious note, I think data flow together with the [layout system]({{ site.url }}/post/post/swiftui-layout-system) is the strongest side of SwiftUI. Both systems are powerful, elegant, and robust.

Most of the current complaints about SwiftUI come with regards to its incomplete component library. There are some glaring gaps there. I wish Apple was more clear in their communication. We've already been there in 2014 when Swift 1.0 was presented as a production-ready language (spoiler alert: it wasn’t). A similar thing is happening with SwiftUI.

SwiftUI in its current form seems more like a proof of concept which goal is to show that Apple's platonic ideal of a UI framework can be brought to reality. It has the best syntax, the best data flow, and the best layout system. The only thing that is lacking is the component library.

Some people also raised performance concerns regarding SwiftUI data flow. I don't necessarily share them. In my experience working on large apps using reactive programming frameworks, I haven't found this to be an issue. And SwiftUI has even more potential for optimization. Views are lightweight. When Apple finishes optimizing SwiftUI, I think you should be able to re-create the entire view graph of you application 60 times a second and the framework should be able to handle it. This might sound outlandish, but not to someone who has written a computer game before.

It seems mind-boggling just how many language features were needed to make SwiftUI possible: reflection, complex generics system, property wrappers, function builders, opaque return types, dynamic member lookup. There is a lot to learn! Fortunately, if you ever used reactive programming and MVVM before, your investment was fully worth it. SwiftUI is the closest thing to it as you can get. This new direction for development for Apple platforms makes me excited for its future.

[^1]: For simplicity, I'm exposing model objects (`Song`) from the view model. If you are closely following MVVM, you would typically want to to create a separate view model for each song instead.
[^2]: Property Wrappers are not an exclusive feature of SwiftUI and can be introduced in ReactiveSwift. There is already a [pull request](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift/pull/762) with a proposed changed. It introduces a new `@Observable` property wrapper. In reality, I think it should completely replace the existing `Property` and `MutableProperty` types.
[^3]: SwiftUI also closes the debate which is often found in [`RxSwift`](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) community whether to make ViewModel pure (aka "pure transformation of inputs to outputs") or allow views to modify the ViewModels. The former sounds cleaner but it is impractical because it requires you to always create your ViewModels after you create a View. I think SwiftUI makes the right decision and goes with a more pragmatic and flexible approach which allows for "late binding" of ViewModels.
